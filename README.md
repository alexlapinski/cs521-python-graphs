# CS521 - Graphs (in Python)

A simple playground to try out different graph algorithms.

I did this in python, mainly because it's quick and easy for me.

I'm trying to implement the algorithms from class, and then slightly tweak them for different purposes.

I want to measure the runtime, and also visualize the graphs easily.

## Requirements
 * Graphviz (installed / available on the path)
 * pipenv
 * python 3.7


## Getting Started
 * Clone the repo
 * Install dependencies (via pipenv)
 * run main_graphs.py (via pipenv)
   ```
   pipenv exec python main.py
   ```
